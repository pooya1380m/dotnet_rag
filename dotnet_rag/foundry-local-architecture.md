# Foundry Local Architecture

Foundry Local is a platform for running AI models and services locally, designed to provide low-latency and secure AI capabilities. It supports various AI models, including large language models and embeddings, with integration for vectordatabases like Qdrant.

## Key Components
- **Model Hosting**: Hosts AI models like Qwen2.5 for chat completion.
- **Embedding Generation**: Supports ONNX-based embedding models like Jina AI embeddings.
- **Vector Database**: Integrates with Qdrant for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
- **Semantic Kernel**: Leverages Semantic Kernel for orchestrating AI services and memory management.

## Benefits
- Low-latency inference for real-time applications.
- Enhanced data privacy by keeping processing local.
- Flexible integration with existing .NET applications.
